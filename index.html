Experiments were also performed where I dropped shuttles from my balcony while recording a video to then validate the data from my simulations.  </p>

						<p class="mb-3  ">Growing up in Kaiga, tucked deep in the Western Ghats, adventure was never a hobby—it was just life. I spent my childhood diving headfirst into reservoir waters, stumbling upon hidden waterfalls with no map in hand, and wasting hours lounging by the	 riverbanks. It was raw, wild, and completely normal. These days, I’m based in Bangalore, navigating the 9-to-5 grind. But come the weekend, that old itch kicks in. Only now, I chase the same adrenaline with a roaring bike and a full tank—still wild at heart, just with better gear. </p> 
						<p class="mb-3  ">When I’m not wandering out of the city on weekends, I usually like to keep things moving. You’ll usually find me rock climbing, out for a run, doing laps in a pool, or smashing birdies on a badminton court. If I’m not in the mood to move, I dive into my little world of hobby projects—tinkering with a Raspberry Pi, plotting model plane builds, or randomly deciding to learn something new, like, say... building this very website (yes, that is how it started). I’ll probably throw together something protein-packed in the kitchen too, just to feel extra productive. But honestly, nothing beats goofing around with my crew.</p>

						<p>I’m not a hardcore foodie, but I’m always up to explore new cuisines, dig up hidden gems or just wander and explore Bangalore. Hit me up with recommendations—or even better, would love some great company to share it with.</p>

					<p>I’ve always had a thing for photography—nothing fancy, just me, my phone, and a habit of pulling it out every time something even slightly interesting catches my eye. Sometimes, it’s turning the ordinary into something cool. Sometimes, it’s climbing something I probably shouldn’t be climbing to get that shot. Is it always worth the risk? Not really. But when it pays off—it’s magic.

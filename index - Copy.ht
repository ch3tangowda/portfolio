						<h3>Deconstructing physics behind Float serve (Thesis Project)</h3>
						<p>Float serve is a volleyball serve used by professional atheletes where the ball swerves randomly after crossing the net. No significant CFD analysis of this had been done till date and hence we solved a part of the problem by understanding how the seams of the volleyball affect it's swerve trajectory with the help of LES simulations in OpenFOAM performed on a supercomputer.</p>

						 	<p> This was the one of the first projects I laid my hands on after learning CAD and CFD where I performed simulations on badminton shuttles to understand the flow behaviour such as wake pattern and vortices around it and how parameters like its angle of attack, skirt angle and feather twist angle etc affected its behavior. Experiments were also performed where I dropped shuttles from my balcony while recording a video to then validate the data from my simulations.  </p>
